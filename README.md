# Power_BI_SuperStore_Sales_Forecast_Dashboard


## Introduction
In the realm of fierce market competition and evolving consumer demands, the Superstore giant is on a quest to optimize its strategies for success. This Power BI project is dedicated to unraveling the secrets hidden within the Superstore's data treasure trove, offering insights that will guide the organization towards targeted growth, enhanced profitability, and superior decision-making.

## Objective
In this project, I have made a interactive Power BI Sales Dashboard on Super_store sales data and find some insights from the data. In order to building the dashboard the ETL process was done as per the requirements, Power query was used to clean and transform the data and DAX was used for creating the culculated measures and culculated column. This dashboard will incorporate advanced charting, interactive filtering, and slicers for enhanced user experience. Additionally, it will include forecasting capabilities to predict sales for the upcoming 15 days. ultimately, the aim is to equip the superstore with data-driven tools to facilitate informed decision-making.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset contains historical sales and profit data for two years i.e. 2019 and 2020, customer information, product information, regional data, and order information. Conducted comprehensive analysis of sales data for a superstore using Excel and applied data cleaning and transformation methods within Power Query in Power BI. This involved addressing data inconsistencies and handling missing data.

## Insights
  1. The sales analysis identified substantial holiday season peaks, particularly during year-end. To easily examine and compare these trends over two years, a stacked area chart is employed, offering a clear visual representation.
  2. In terms of sales, the technology and office supplies categories take the lead, while the subcategories of phones and chairs emerge as top performers. These insights can be effectively visualized and analyzed using a bar chart.
  3. The consumer segment and the western region stand out as the most profitable, and this information can be effectively visualized using a donut chart, which provides a clear and concise representation of the data while allowing for easy comparison between categories.

## Forecasting using Power BI Forecast Tool
One of the key features of this project is the utilization of the Power BI Forecast tool. By leveraging this tool, accurate sales forecasts are generated based on historical sales data. This forecasting capability helps businesses plan and make informed decisions for future sales strategies and resource allocation.

## Dashboard
Leveraged PowerBI visualization tools and DAX functions to design insightful charts and user-friendly dashboard. Users have the flexibility to apply real-time filters, enabling a targeted analysis of specific metrics and facilitating deeper insights.

## Challenges and Learnings
  1. Proficiency in Chart Selection: Recognizing the appropriate chart types and their respective applications.
  2. Regional Analysis: Recognizing the importance of regional-specific insights, necessitating context-aware analysis through filters and slicers.
  3. Boosting Customer Engagement: Acquiring an understanding of customer preferences to improve engagement and enhance the dashboard's visual appeal.

## Conclusion
Through the analysis of the superstore sales data and the implementation of sales forecasting using Power BI, this project provides valuable insights for business owners and decision-makers. By understanding customer behavior, identifying top-performing products, and utilizing accurate sales forecasts, businesses can optimize their operations and drive growth effectively.
